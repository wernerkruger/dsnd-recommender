    "\n",
    "2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: We apply TruncatedSVD (Latent Semantic Analysis) to reduce the dimensionality from 200 features to 50 components, which helps capture semantic relationships while reducing noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Clustering**: We use KMeans clustering with 50 clusters to group articles with similar content together based on their title similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Recommendations**: When a user interacts with an article, we find all articles in the same cluster and rank them by popularity (number of user interactions) using `get_ranked_article_unique_counts`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Possible Improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **More Text Data**: Currently we only use article titles. We could improve recommendations by using:\n",
    "   - Article descriptions/summaries\n",
    "   - Article body text\n",
    "   - Tags or categories\n",
    "   - Author information\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Better Clustering**: We could experiment with different clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering) or use more sophisticated NLP techniques like word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hybrid Approach**: Combine content-based recommendations with collaborative filtering for better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **User Preferences**: Incorporate user feedback (likes, ratings) to refine recommendations within clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other Text Data That Would Be Useful:\n",
